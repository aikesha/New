# Robotics II: Control and Modelling Laboratory [ROBT 403]
### Note: This repository was created for laboratory assignments.

## Laboratory 1-2
* Ubuntu Installation
* ROS Installation
* ROS Tutorials

## Laboratory 3
* Planar robot model installation
* Create a node that will send a square-wave function and sine-wave function (rqt+ Gazebo)
* PID control of joints (rqt + Gazebo)

## Laboratory 4
* Moveit configuration.
* Moving the robot from script (RViz + Gazebo + Cpp file) that moves the "end" to draw a rectangle and a circle.

## Laboratory 5
* Modelling of a 3DOF RRR Manipultor in MatLab/Simulink
* Joint Control of RRR Manipulator by using Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox in MatLab

## Laboratory 5 (Part 2) 
* Joint Control of RRR Manipulator by using Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox in MatLab
* This laboratory uses Lab 5 materials for PID control in Simulink.

## Laboratory 6: 
* Obtain Forward Kinematics without the robot model using Matlab scripts by tuning the Neural Networks

## Laboratory 7
* Obtain Inverse Kinematics without the robot model using Matlab scripts by tuning the Neural Networks

## Laboratory 8: 
* Deep Reinforcement Learning by ROS-Gazebo-RViz* to solve IK problem
* Note: In this project I used the package rl_ws package.
* Goal: To locate Planar robot's end-effector to the desired location.
